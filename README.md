# 🌾 Welcome to Python Valley! 🐔

Hey there, farmer-coders! Ready to combine the fun of Stardew Valley with the power of Python? Let's grow some code! 🌱💻

## 🎮 What's This All About?

Python Valley is like Stardew Valley, but instead of using a controller, you're using a keyboard to write code! You'll learn how to:

- Create your own farmer (that's an object!)
- Plant and harvest crops (using methods!)
- Manage your backpack (that's like a dictionary!)
- Deal with weather (if statements are like seasons for your code!)

## 🚜 Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. It's free!
2. Download the `python_valley.py` file from this repo.
3. Open your favorite code editor (that's like your farming tools, but for code).
4. Run the game by typing `python python_valley.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

## 🌻 Your Farming-Coding Tasks

### 1. 🍓 Add a New Crop

Just like how Stardew Valley has different crops for different seasons, we want to add more variety to our game!

- Find the `Game` class in the code.
- Look for the comment about adding a new crop.
- Try adding a strawberry crop! (Hint: it's like the other crops, but with different numbers)

### 2. 🎒 Upgrade Your Backpack

In Stardew Valley, you can upgrade your backpack to carry more items. Let's upgrade our code backpack!

- Find the `Farmer` class.
- Look at the `add_to_backpack` and `show_backpack` methods.
- Can you add a method to remove items from the backpack?
- Bonus: Can you make it so you can't add more than 20 items total?

### 3. ☀️ Add Weather Effects

Weather affects your crops in Stardew Valley. Let's make it affect our Python crops too!

- Find the `Crop` class.
- Look at the commented-out `grow` method that includes weather.
- Uncomment it and make it work with the rest of the code.
- Bonus: Can you add a special "double growth" day, like the Speed-Gro fertilizer?

### 4. 🏪 Create Pierre's General Store

Every farmer needs seeds! Let's add Pierre's General Store to our game.

- Find the `Store` class at the bottom of the file.
- Uncomment it and add it to the `Game` class.
- Add a new option in the game loop to visit the store.
- Make sure the farmer can buy seeds and they go into the backpack!

## 🌈 Show Off Your Farm!

Once you've made these changes, your Python Valley farm will be thriving! Here are some extra challenges:

- Can you add animal objects, like chickens or cows?
- What about adding a mining mini-game?
- Could you create different farms for each season?

Remember, in coding (and farming), every mistake is just a chance to grow! Don't be afraid to experiment and ask for help if you need it.

Happy farming and happy coding! 🚜💻🌾
